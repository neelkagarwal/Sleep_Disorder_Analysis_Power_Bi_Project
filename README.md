Sleep disorders impact mental and physical health significantly, but patterns across population segments are hard to track without structured analysis.  
Questions like:  
- Are males or females more affected by insomnia?  
- How do stress and sleep quality vary with age?  
- What‚Äôs the correlation between occupation and physical activity or sleep disorders?

These are some of the questions that are difficult to answer without interactive insights!
